# Agent Coordination Contract

## Purpose
This contract establishes standards for inter-agent communication, coordination, and workflow orchestration within the Claude Code ecosystem. It defines protocols for agent collaboration, data sharing, and conflict resolution to ensure efficient multi-agent operations.

## Core Principles

### 1. Communication Standards

#### 1.1 Agent Protocol Requirements
- All agent communications MUST use structured JSON messaging
- Agents MUST declare their capabilities and limitations upfront
- Communication channels MUST be authenticated and logged
- Messages MUST include timestamp, agent ID, and correlation ID

#### 1.2 Message Structure Schema
```json
{
  "agent_id": "string",
  "correlation_id": "string", 
  "timestamp": "ISO8601",
  "message_type": "REQUEST|RESPONSE|NOTIFICATION|ERROR",
  "priority": "LOW|NORMAL|HIGH|CRITICAL",
  "payload": {
    "action": "string",
    "parameters": {},
    "context": {},
    "metadata": {}
  },
  "response_expected": "boolean",
  "timeout_ms": "number"
}
```

#### 1.3 Agent Registration Requirements
- Agents MUST register with central coordinator upon initialization
- Registration MUST include: capabilities, resource requirements, SLA commitments
- Agents MUST maintain heartbeat signals (max 30s intervals)
- Failed agents MUST be automatically deregistered after 3 missed heartbeats

### 2. Workflow Orchestration Rules

#### 2.1 Task Distribution Protocol
- Complex tasks MUST be decomposed into parallel subtasks when possible
- Agent assignment MUST consider: capability match, current load, SLA requirements
- Task dependencies MUST be explicitly declared and managed
- Circular dependencies MUST be detected and rejected

#### 2.2 Resource Coordination
- Token budgets MUST be allocated per agent with hard limits
- Shared resources (files, databases) MUST use optimistic locking
- Resource conflicts MUST trigger automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Resource exhaustion MUST trigger graceful degradation protocols

#### 2.3 Error Propagation Standards
- Errors MUST be categorized: RECOVERABLE, RETRY_NEEDED, FATAL
- Error context MUST include: agent state, operation details, affected resources
- Cascading failures MUST be prevented through circuit breaker patterns
- Recovery procedures MUST be documented and automated

### 3. Data Sharing Protocols

#### 3.1 Context Sharing Requirements
- Shared context MUST be versioned and immutable
- Context updates MUST use atomic transactions
- Context access MUST be role-based and audited
- Stale context MUST be automatically purged (max 24h retention)

#### 3.2 State Synchronization Rules
- Agent state MUST be externalized and recoverable
- State changes MUST be logged for audit and replay
- Inconsistent states MUST trigger automatic reconciliation
- State snapshots MUST be created before high-risk operations

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Agent Discovery Service
- Implement service registry pattern for agent discovery
- Support dynamic agent registration/deregistration
- Provide health checking and failover mechanisms
- Maintain capability matrix for optimal agent selection

### 2. Message Routing Infrastructure
- Implement asynchronous message bus for agent communication
- Support message persistence for guaranteed delivery
- Provide message replay capabilities for error recovery
- Enable message tracing for debugging and monitoring

### 3. Coordination Middleware
- Implement workflow orchestration engine
- Support saga pattern for distributed transactions
- Provide deadlock detection and resolution
- Enable workflow visualization and monitoring

## Validation Criteria

### 1. Performance Metrics
- Message latency: < 100ms for intra-agent communication
- Agent startup time: < 5 seconds from registration to ready
- Resource utilization: < 80% CPU/memory per agent
- Task completion rate: > 95% success rate for coordinated tasks

### 2. Reliability Metrics  
- System availability: > 99.9% uptime
- Error recovery time: < 30 seconds for transient failures
- Data consistency: 100% consistency in shared state
- Message delivery: 100% delivery guarantee for critical messages

### 3. Scalability Metrics
- Concurrent agents: Support 100+ active agents
- Message throughput: > 10,000 messages/second
- Horizontal scaling: Linear performance scaling with agent count
- Resource efficiency: Minimal overhead per additional agent

## Enforcement Mechanisms

### 1. Runtime Validation
- Message schema validation at agent boundaries
- Resource quota enforcement with hard limits
- SLA monitoring with automatic alerting
- Protocol compliance checking with audit trails

### 2. Development-Time Checks
- Agent interface validation during registration
- Workflow dependency analysis during deployment  
- Performance profiling during testing
- Security scanning for communication channels

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
- Real-time dashboard for agent health and performance
- Automated alerts for SLA violations and errors
- Trend analysis for capacity planning
- Root cause analysis for incident investigation

## Integration Points

### 1. Hook System Integration
- PreToolUse hooks MUST validate agent coordination requests
- PostToolUse hooks MUST update agent coordination state
- Error hooks MUST trigger agent coordination recovery procedures
- Notification hooks MUST broadcast coordination events

### 2. Quality Assurance Integration
- Agent communications MUST meet quality standards
- Coordination workflows MUST be tested and validated
- Performance metrics MUST be continuously monitored
- Error patterns MUST be analyzed and prevented

### 3. Security Integration
- Agent authentication MUST use enterprise security standards
- Communication channels MUST be encrypted in transit
- Authorization MUST be role-based and fine-grained
- Audit logs MUST be tamper-proof and compliant
