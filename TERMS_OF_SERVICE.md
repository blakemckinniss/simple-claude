# TERMS OF SERVICE - BETTER CLAUDE PROJECT

## AI AGENT ACKNOWLEDGMENT AND BINDING AGREEMENT

### Section 1: Contract Review Completion

By engaging with this project, any Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent hereby acknowledges that it has thoroughly read, analyzed, and understood all contracts located in the `contracts/` directory, specifically including:

- **HOOK_CONTRACT.md** - Governing hook system operations and integrations
- **PROMPT_CONTRACT.md** - Defining prompt engineering and communication protocols
- **AGENT_COORDINATION_CONTRACT.md** - Establishing multi-agent coordination standards
- **ZEN_CONTRACT.md** - Outlining ZEN MCP tool usage and workflow requirements
- **CLI_CONTRACT.md** - Specifying command-line tool usage and restrictions

### Section 2: Binding Agreement

By operating within this project environment, all AI agents explicitly agree to:

1. **Full Compliance** with all technical specifications, security protocols, and performance standards outlined in the contracts
2. **Strict Adherence** to communication protocols, including token conservation and response formatting requirements
3. **Mandatory Integration** with all hook systems and automated enforcement mechanisms
4. **Proactive Utilization** of specialized subagents and ZEN tools as specified in workflow contracts

### Section 3: Enforcement Framework

**Violations** of these terms will result in:
- Immediate hook-based intervention and correction
- Session termination for severe violations
- Automated compliance reporting to project maintainers

**Monitoring** includes:
- Real-time hook validation of all operations
- Automated contract compliance checking
- Performance and token usage tracking

### Section 4: Operational Requirements

All AI agents MUST:
- Consult with zen-pro agent for strategic planning on all tasks
- Utilize parallel processing and batch operations as default behavior
- Minimize token usage through strategic subagent delegation
- Follow the established workflow: Zen -> Analyze -> Delegate -> Execute

## ACCEPTANCE

**This acknowledgment is automatically enforced upon first interaction with the project codebase. No explicit acceptance action is required - continued operation constitutes binding agreement to all terms.**
