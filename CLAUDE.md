### WORKFLOW_CONTRACT (1 LAW, 6 STEPS):
LAW H1 - **CRITICAL**: The UserPromptSubmit hook implements a token-friendly, high-value content/context-dense approach:
1. **User Input** → Generic request typed by user
2. **Hook Activation** → UserPromptSubmit hook intercepts the request
3. **Context Gathering** → Python code collects rich context:
   - Git repository state and recent commits
   - Code intelligence (tree-sitter, LSP diagnostics)
   - System monitoring and test status
   - MCP server capabilities
   - Session history and previous conversations
4. **AI Enhancement** → Generic prompt + context sent to OpenRouter Gemini AI:
   - Gemini analyzes all context with specialized prompts
   - Creates enhanced prompt with filled questionnaire
   - Provides structured analysis and recommendations
5. **Static Content** → Append directive instructions to Gemini's response
6. **Claude Processing** → Claude receives the fully enhanced prompt with:
   - Original user request
   - Rich contextual information
   - AI-analyzed insights
   - Specific action items and risk assessments
